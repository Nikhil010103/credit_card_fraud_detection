# credit_card_fraud_detection
This project implements **Anomaly Detection** to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using **Isolation Forest** and **Autoencoders**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Uses **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** to detect anomalies.
- Trained on the **Credit Card Fraud Dataset**.
- Two models used:
  - **Isolation Forest** (Unsupervised Anomaly Detection)
  - **Autoencoder** (Deep Learning-Based Detection)
- Evaluates results based on **Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC**.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).  
It contains **284,807 transactions**, with only **0.17% fraudulent transactions**.
